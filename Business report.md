# 📘 Business Report: BMW Used Car Market Analysis  
### Prepared for a Small Business Owner

---

## **1. Objective**

The business owner wants to understand whether he should focus on acquiring **Diesel** or **Petrol (Gasoline)** BMW cars for the next quarter.  

## **2. Data Warning**
Before diving into the results, it’s important to acknowledge a few things about the dataset

- *We don’t know exactly where the data comes from or how it was collected.*
  
That means there could be some natural bias in what’s included (for example, certain models or years might be over‑represented).

- *We also don’t know whether this is the full picture*
  
There may be other sources or variables—like vehicle condition, seller type, or accident history—that aren’t captured here.

Even with these limitations, the dataset still gives enough clarity to explore the relationship between fuel type, mileage, and price, and to confidently answer the business owner’s main question.

## **3. Evidence & Insights**

From this graph, we can see that Diesel and Petrol cars make up the largest share of the dataset, so it makes sense to focus the analysis on these two fuel types. Diesel has the highest presence with a little over 7,027 listings, followed by Petrol with around 3,417 listings.

###**Evidence**
The statistical tests confirm that fuel type is strongly connected to both mileage and price.
- Mileage t‑test: Diesel cars have significantly higher mileage (≈ +13.3k miles).
- Price t‑test: Petrol cars are significantly more expensive (≈ $2.1k–$3k difference).
- Correlation tests: Fuel type shows meaningful correlations with both mileage and price.
  
The visuals reinforce these findings.

- Boxplots clearly show the gap in both mileage and price between Diesel and Petrol.

- Heatmap highlights that Diesel cars dominate the 20–40k and 40–60k mileage ranges, while Petrol is strongest in the 0–20k range.

- Together, these visuals make the differences easy to interpret and support the insights above.

### Insights
The analysis shows a very clear pattern in how Diesel and Petrol BMWs behave in the market. Petrol cars consistently sell for more, even though they have much lower mileage. Diesel cars, on the other hand, tend to be more used and therefore cheaper. This creates a strong opportunity for the business owner: focusing on Petrol cars with low mileage can increase overall sales value and attract buyers looking for newer, higher‑value vehicles.
- Petrol car price is on average $2.3k–$3k higher than Diesel.
- Petrol cars with around 16.5k miles can be sold at a higher price than Diesel.
- Diesel cars have on average +13.3k more miles than Petrol and are therefore cheaper.
- There is an opportunity to increase sales value by selling more low‑mileage Petrol cars.

## **7. Recommendation**

Based on the statistical tests and visual analysis:

Based on the statistical tests and visual analysis:
- If the business owner wants higher‑value, lower‑mileage inventory, the focus should be on Petrol (Gasoline) BMWs. When considering this option, it’s important to look at how saturated the local market currently is and whether Petrol supply remains stable.
- If the goal is lower acquisition cost and serving long‑distance drivers, Diesel remains a viable niche. This works well if customers are looking for more affordable cars and if Diesel supply continues to be reliable.
- It’s also worth reviewing the performance of electric and hybrid cars; if they tend to move slowly, it may be better to keep the main focus on the two strongest fuel types and only stock small quantities of others.
- Since these fuel types represent different product segments, it’s helpful to understand customer segmentation more deeply. Knowing who is buying used cars and what they value will support better inventory decisions.

So, assuming the goal is to improve financial performance and the customer base leans toward the higher‑end segment (to be confirmed with a customer study), the recommendation for the next quarter is to allocate around 60% of new inventory to low‑mileage Petrol cars, with the remaining percentage dedicated to Diesel cars.
